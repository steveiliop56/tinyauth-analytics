A simple bun script to fetch analytics from the API server and display them in a human readable format.

## Usage

Make sure you have the dependencies installed (typescript pretty much):

```sh
bun install
```

Run the script with:

```sh
bun main.ts
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also pass a custom API server URL as an argument. For example `bun main.ts https://api.tinyauth.app`.
