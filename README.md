# Tinyauth analytics

A simple server to transparently collect version information from Tinyauth instances.

## How does it work

Every Tinyauth instance runs a goroutine (unless you choose to opt-out) that does a "heartbeat" every 12 hours indicating the instance is still alive. The heartbeat contains the UUID generated by Tinyauth on start up and the version information. The server stores them in the SQLite database alongside with the last seen date. When you request all the instances, the server responds with an array containing the versions, UUIDs and last seen dates.

## Running

The central information server is hosted at `api.tinyauth.app/v1/` and all instance information can be requested from the `/v1/instances/all` endpoint. But, if you would like to run your own server for your own projects, you can by simply cloning the repository and running:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to edit the environment variables to suit your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> The docker compose file builds the image from scratch by default but there are also available prebuilt images in the packages section.
